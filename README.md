# 🩺 Heart Disease Analysis & Prediction

This project aims to **analyze and predict Heart Disease** using Python’s data analysis libraries.  
It focuses on exploring the key factors that influence the likelihood of heart disease.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Heart Disease Prediction dataset  
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Objective:** To explore data, visualize patterns, and understand the relationship between health indicators and heart disease.

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Heart Disease** tends to increase with higher **Cholesterol** and **RestingBP** values.  
- People with **Exercise Angina = Yes** are more likely to have heart disease.  
- Lower **MaxHR** (Maximum Heart Rate) is associated with a higher chance of heart disease.
